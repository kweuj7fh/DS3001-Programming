    "The table above displays the careers I researched, organized according to my personal ranking. Several factors influenced this ranking. Firstly, I looked at salary. As such, the higher-paying jobs ranked higher on my list. I also considered the typical entry-level education requirements, as I currently do not plan to pursue a master's degree until at least 5-6 years after gaining work experience. I also factored in the number of current jobs and the projected job outlook. This is why careers like data scientists and computer scientists are ranked higher than I might have initially placed them. Lastly, I factored in my own educational and professional background, as well as my personal interests. I am a double major in Economics and Computer Science, with a minor in Data Science. I have a strong interest in finance, and therefore, financial analysts and financial managers are ranked higher on my list."
